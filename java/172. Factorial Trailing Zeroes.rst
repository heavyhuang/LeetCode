Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

code:
::
 
  public static class Solution {
        public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
            int count = 0;
            while (n>=1){
                n /= 5;
                count += n;
            }
            return count;
        }
    }
