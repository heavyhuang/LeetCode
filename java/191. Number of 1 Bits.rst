Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

code:
::
 
  public static class Solution {
        // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
        public int hammingWeight(int n) {
            int count =0;
            while (n!=0) {           //n>0时会判断有符号
                count += n&1;
                n = n >>> 1;
            }
            return count;
        }
    }
