You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

code:
::
 
  public static class Solution {
        public int climbStairs(int n) {
            double m = Math.sqrt(5);
            return (int)((1/m) * ((Math.pow((1 + m)/2,n+1) - Math.pow((1 - m)/2,n+1))));
        }
    }
